# OCR Mobile App Project

## Overview

Welcome to the OCR Mobile App project, a cutting-edge endeavor that merges innovative technologies to create a seamless mobile experience. Our project combines a powerful Node.js backend with Python scripts that leverage Paddle OCR for text detection. The result is an exceptional mobile application that empowers users to capture images and compare text, opening up a world of possibilities in image-to-text recognition.

## Key Repositories

To explore the different facets of our OCR Mobile App, please refer to the following repositories:

- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/aks1809/ocr-backend): This repository houses the formidable Node.js backend that forms the project's backbone. It orchestrates communication between the frontend and Python scripts, offering a robust API for text detection and comparison.

- [Flutter Frontend Repository](https://github.com/aks1809/ocr-flutter-frontend): Discover our Flutter-based frontend that captivates users with a visually appealing and highly functional interface. This repository represents the culmination of our team's dedication to crafting an exceptional mobile experience.

- [React Native Frontend Repository](https://github.com/aks1809/ocr-react-native-frontend): Alternatively, explore our React Native-based frontend, showcasing the versatility of our application by offering a distinct UI for the same OCR capabilities.

## Project Highlights

### Node.js Backend
Our Node.js backend is the core of our application, and it shines in several ways:

- **Seamless Communication:** It seamlessly facilitates communication between the frontend and Python scripts, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Efficient Text Detection:** Leveraging Paddle OCR, our backend performs efficient and precise text detection within images, making it a powerful tool for various use cases.

### Flutter and React Native Frontends
Our project boasts not one, but two exceptional frontends:

- **Flutter Frontend:** Our Flutter-based frontend combines eye-catching design with exceptional functionality, providing users with an elegant and intuitive interface for image capture and text comparison.

- **React Native Frontend:** For those who prefer React Native, our alternative frontend offers the same robust OCR functionality, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across platforms.
